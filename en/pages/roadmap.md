## 2016

This year has been focused on shipping an initial core set of features, packaged as a web platform and a mobile application, including:

- a content management system with categories, contents, versions, users and activities,
- a web designer/editor with a rich toolset,
- a web player/reader.

## 2017

Next year should be about strengthening our application and infrastructure, building content and driving traffic.

We have limited plans to build new core features in 2017 but we are considering:

- improving the content management system with organisations and content sets (channels, courses, books);
- improving the designer and player with new tools possibly including shapes, tables, charts, code editing, geometric/function graphs and chemical drawings.

We are also considering exploring integrations with Google Classroom and Apple Classroom, especially to assign work and report scores.

## 2018

The following year, we plan to introduce paid subscriptions for premium services including private content, class management, work assignments and score analytics.
Possibly, we are also considering paid premium content.
