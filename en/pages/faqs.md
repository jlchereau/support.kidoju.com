![Frequently Asked Questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kidoju/support.kidoju.com/master/en/pages/faqs.jpg)

## Why Kidoju?

In average, teachers spend 19 hours teaching and 5 hours marking/correcting student work among other weekly tasks
(Source: [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/edu/EAG2014-Indicator%20D4%20(eng).pdf)). They want to spend more time teaching and less time correcting.
  
By the time students get corrections, the momentum to fill knowledge gaps is lost, which limits the benefits of homework.
Instant corrections motivate students to fill such gaps before reaching the next course chapter.

## What is Kidoju?

Kidoju is a web platform to design and share highly-interactive self-corrected knowledge tests.

Designing a Kidoju knowledge test is very similar to designing a Microsoft PowerPointÂ© presentation,
except the Kidoju toolset has the ability to record answers and calculate scores.

## What is free?

We strongly believe that knowledge should be free but we also need to fund our costs.
Therefore sharing your contributions publicly on the Kidoju platform is free and you only pay for data you want to keep private.

## How does Kidoju compare with Coursera, EdX, Khan Academy, Lynda and other Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) platforms?

Kidoju is not a substitute for the classroom experience. We believe in the benefits of face-to-face interactions in education.
Kidoju is a substitute for printed and photocopied exercises, leveraging mobile devices.

## How does Kidoju compare with Quizlet, Socrative, and other Quiz web sites?

Quizlet and Socrative have benefits, especially to learn lists or instantly poll classrooms.
The simplicity of such tools is also their weakness when student assessments involve more that multiple choice questions.
This is when Kidoju kicks in.
