## It always starts with a vision

### The Context

Kidoju started in the UK at the end of 2013 with two of my children respectively practising their 11+ and SAT tests.

My daughter's teachers would provide her with tons of photocopied practise tests and she would regularly ask me to derive
similar exercises to help her check her comprehension of the correction and practise again after failing a question. 

My son purchased a large collection of SAT practice tests from Barron's, CollegeBoard, Kaplan, Princeton Review and others
but any of these books would be far to bulky to carry in order to practise during transportation or lunch time.

Being a mobile device enthusiast, I have naturally turned to iTunes to find education material to assist them in their revisions.

Still today, driving theory tests, brain games and foreign language learning make the top grossing education apps on iTunes
and the **school toolkit** recommended by Apple is essentially made of productivity apps:

In fact, there are very few decent mobile apps to comprehensively support our children's education through their curriculum.
Quizlet and Khan Academy are certainly among them but none can be considered as a replacement for classroom photocopied exercises.  

### The Market

The education software market is actually divided into three main categories:

- [Learning Management Systems (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) help schools and universities manage students, teachers and classes;
- [Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) expand access to education by providing online video courses; 
- A very wide and atomized range of highly specialized applications, each targeting a specific topic (english, maths) and/or a specific use case (smart cards, multiple choice questions).

### The Vision

- What if there was a more engaging and fun way to practise than paper forms to fill in?
- What if students could practice and assess their knowledge anytime anywhere without carrying heavy books?
- What if students could get instant corrections without involving teachers and parents?
- What if parents could provide as many exercises as their children require to master any topics?
- What if teachers could spend less time correcting student work and more time actually teaching face-to-face? 
- What if any effort to build new exercises could be shared and re-used by others again and again?
- What if a single application could cover any topics for any age groups?
- What if schools could spare the burden and cost of photocopies?

This is our vision for Kidoju.
