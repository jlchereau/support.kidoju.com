## It always starts with a vision

### The Context

Kidoju started in the UK at the end of 2013 with two of my children respectively practising their 11+ and SAT tests.

My daughter's teachers would provide her with tons of photocopied practise tests and she would regularly ask me to derive
a similar exercise with a new set of parameters in order to check her comprehension of the correction and practise again after failing a question. 

My son purchased a large collection of SAT practice tests from Barron's, CollegeBoard, Kaplan, Princeton Review and others
but any of these books would be far to bulky to carry in order to practise during transportation or lunch time.

Being a mobile device enthusiast, I have naturally turned to iTunes to find education material to assist them in their revisions.
Still today, theory tests for car drivers, brain games and learning foreign languages make the top grossing apps on iTunes and
the **school toolkit** recommended by Apple is essentially made of productivity apps.

In fact, there are very few if no decent apps to comprehensively support our children's education through their curriculum. 

### The Market

The software education market is actually divided into three main categories:

- [Learning Management Systems (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) help schools and universities manage students, teachers and classes;
- [Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) expand access to education by providing online video courses; 
- A very wide and atomized range of highly specialized applications, each target a specific topic (writing, comprehension, maths, physics, foreign language, history, geography, ...)
  for a specific age group or test.

### The Vision

- What if schools could spare photocopies?
- What if there was a more engaging and fun way to practise than black & white forms to fill in?
- What if students could practice and assess their knowledge anytime anywhere without carrying heavy books?
- What if students could get instant corrections without involving teachers and parents?
- What if parents could provide as many exercises as their children require to master any topics?
- What if teachers could spend less time correcting assessments and more time actually teaching face-to-face? 
- What if any effort to build new exercises could be shared and re-used by others again and again?
- What if a single application could cover any topics for any age groups?

This is our vision for Kidoju.
