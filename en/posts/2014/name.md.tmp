With a [vision](vision) for a new quiz system, we needed a name.

Quizzes tend to refer to multiple choice questions, with A, B, C, D answers like you find on Socrative or Coursera.
Our vision concerned a new system which is both community-driven and highly interactive, with multimedia widgets and drag and drop features.
The design of our system would only be limited by the capacity to compare a student-produced answer with the teacher-designed solution.
Considering this design, our system could also host mind games like sudokus and crosswords since the comparison between an answer and a solution applies to calculate a score.
Would anyone designate a sudoku or a crossword as a quiz?

So we wanted a new name that:

1. was available, especially as a .COM domain name;
2. sounded like a new mind game, e.g. *sudoku*;
3. would reflect the fact that our *quizzes* are on steroids (more interactive than multiple choice questions and encompassing sudokus and quizzes);
4. would ideally suggest a community;
5. would also refer to youth, fun and entertainment.

This is how we came up with Kidoju, defined as follows:

### Kidoju

/kɪdəʊdʒu/

*noun*

> a highly interactive digital test of knowledge or skill, especially as a competition between individuals or as a form of entertainment.
